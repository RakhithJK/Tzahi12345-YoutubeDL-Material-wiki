**This is just a short notice to all Synology users who may experience problems launching the application.**

As found out in [this issue](https://github.com/Tzahi12345/YoutubeDL-Material/issues/449#issuecomment-921386012) Synology users may want to consider unlocking all firewall settings for private IP.
(or playing around with safe middlegrounds if possible - the writer of this page doesn't have a Synology NAS of their own, so ymmv!)

If any further tips and guides for Synology become known to us we will update the page as they are brought to our attention. :)
